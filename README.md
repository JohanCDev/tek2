# tek2_projects_at_Epitech_Nantes

This repository contains most of projects done in my second year at Epitech.

## Before continuing...

This project is an EPITECH Project. If you are an EPITECH student, move out the way! Nothing to see here... I don't want to be involved to your -42.
If you're not, no worries! You're welcome here!

### Building program

Most of project can be build with make / make re rules
Launch the binary with the flags if necessary
Clean all the project with make clean / make fclean
Note that I did most project on a M1 chip MacBook.

### Coding Style

All of the projects are developed with C/C++ except for maths that are in Python. EPITECH doesn't impose it's Coding Style certain projects
and I tried to follow it as much as possible.
